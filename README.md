# Semantic-Segmentation
Leveraged comprehensive knowledge and practical skills acquired from a deep learning course specializing in Image Semantic Segmentation, encompassing real-world applications, hands-on experience with diverse segmentation architectures, data preprocessing, performance evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization, to successfully deploy semantic segmentation for image analysis in a project. This project specifically tackled the intricate task of automatic food tray analysis in canteens and restaurants, introducing an innovative [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)-based approach that unified food localization, recognition, and segmentation to achieve precise prediction of multiple food items from tray images.
